# CapStone Project for NTUC Module VLC-SCAI012-24-0652

## Project Description

### Objectives

To implement a credit risk assessment model for personal loans, it can be utilized to evaluate loan applications, determining both the approval status and the appropriate loan amount to be sanctioned.

### Project Type

Machine Learning Model for Credit Risk Assessment

### Problem to address

- The existing credit risk system is advanced and well-developed, but the cost of issuing loans remains high.
- Many individuals may seek loans but fail to meet the bankâ€™s qualification criteria, even if they pose a low risk of default.
- Some borrowers may receive loans that exceed their actual needs.
- Conducting timely re-evaluations of repayment capability is both expensive and time-consuming.

### The motivation for why you find this project interesting

- AI combined with big data can enable faster, lower-risk, and more cost-effective credit risk assessments.
- More people will benefit from easier, faster, and cheaper access to bank loans.
